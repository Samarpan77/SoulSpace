"Soul space" is a term often used in spiritual and personal growth contexts to describe an inner space where one can connect with their true self or essence—what some might call the "soul." It’s seen as a sacred or deeply personal place within, separate from external noise, stress, and roles, where one finds inner peace, clarity, and a sense of authentic purpose.
